Citi Bike Analysis


Dashboard #1: Map of Stations and # of Rides
- Map is filtered to show stations that had a minimum of 1000 rides that started from them. Larger dots indicate a higher number of rides.
- The stations that have the highest numbers of bike trips ending at are either train stations (that cyclists probably go to to catch a train and commute to work), or they are centrally located. 


Dashboard #2: Average Monthly Ridership & Daily Ride Count: Jan - Mar. 2023
- Average ridership went down from January to February, and increased from February to March. This is probably because temperature in February was colder and there        were more weather events (ice/snow). There are also fewer days in February, which may also contribute to the reduced ridership numbers.
- It's difficult to know for sure why ridership numbers fluctuate daily, but most likely ridership is higher when the weather is better and temperatures are warmer.

Dashboard #3: Bike Type & Subscriber Info.
- Classic bike were consistently three times more likely to be rented than electric bikes. Explanations include fewer electric bikes or a higher rental fee for them. - All bike types followed the same monthly trends in ridership.
- Citi Bike program members had four to five times more rides than casual riders. Interestingly, casual riders appear to be more likely to use an electric bike; while classic bike rides outnumbered electric bike rides about four to one for members, they only out numbered electric bike rides about two to one for casual riders.
